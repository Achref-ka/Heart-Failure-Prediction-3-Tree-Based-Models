## 🧪 Notebook Overview: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

In this notebook, we will explore predictive modeling techniques to estimate the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using patient data. The goal is to compare different machine learning algorithms and understand how their parameters influence performance.

### 🔍 Objectives

- 📁 Work with a dataset related to cardiovascular health
- 🧠 Build three predictive models to estimate disease risk:
  - 🌳 **Decision Tree** using `scikit-learn`
  - 🌲 **Random Forest** using `scikit-learn`
  - ⚡ **XGBoost** using the `xgboost` library
- 🔧 Investigate how hyperparameters affect model accuracy.
- 📊 Evaluate and compare model performance using classification metrics

---

#### By the end of this notebook, we'll gain hands-on experience with tree-based classifiers and learn how to tune them for optimal results in real-world health prediction tasks.
